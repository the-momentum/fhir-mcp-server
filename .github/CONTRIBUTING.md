# How to contribute to the FHIR MCP Server

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Make sure `uv` is installed.
4. Create a new branch for your contribution.
5. Develop changes.
6. Run `uv run pre-commit --all-files` before commiting and fix potential issues raised by formatted, linter or type checker.
7. Commit your chages and push entire branch to the remote (`git push -u origin <local_branch_name>`). It will automatically create a Pull Request here.

Your contributions are more than welcome! :)
