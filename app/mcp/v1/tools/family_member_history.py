    Makes an HTTP request to the FHIR server.
    Use this tool to perform CRUD operations only on the FHIR FamilyMemberHistory resource.
    Rules:
        - When creating or updating a family member history, use only the data explicitly
          provided by the user.
        - Do not guess, auto-fill, or assume any missing data.
        - When deleting a family member history, ask the user for confirmation with details
          of the family member history and wait for the user's confirmation.
        - Provide links to the app (not api) family member history resource in the final response.

    Args:
        method: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
        path: Resource path (e.g., "/FamilyMemberHistory",
             "/FamilyMemberHistory?patient=Patient/123")
        body: Optional JSON data for POST/PUT requests)

    Returns:
        JSON response from the FHIR server
