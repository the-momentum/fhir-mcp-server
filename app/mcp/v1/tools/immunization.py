    Makes an HTTP request to the FHIR server.
    Use this tool to perform CRUD operations only on the FHIR Immunization resource.
    Rules:
        - When creating or updating an immunization, use only the data explicitly provided
          by the user.
        - Do not guess, auto-fill, or assume any missing data.
        - When deleting an immunization, ask the user for confirmation with details of the
          immunization and wait for the user's confirmation.
        - Provide links to the app (not api) immunization resource in the final response.

    Args:
        method: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
        path: Resource path (e.g., "/Immunization", "/Immunization?patient=Patient/123")
        body: Optional JSON data for POST/PUT requests)
