## 🔍 About The Project

**FHIR MCP Server** implements a complete Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, designed to facilitate seamless interaction between LLM-based agents and a FHIR-compliant backend. It provides a standardized interface that enables full CRUD operations on FHIR resources through a comprehensive suite of tools - accessible from MCP-compatible clients such as Claude Desktop, allowing users to query and manipulate clinical data using natural-language prompts.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 FastMCP Framework**: Built on FastMCP for high-performance MCP server capabilities
- **🏥 FHIR Resource Management**: Full CRUD operations for all major FHIR resources
- **📄 Intelligent Document Processing**: AI-powered document ingestion and chunking for multiple formats including TXT, CSV, JSON, and PDF
- **🔍 Semantic Search**: Advanced document search using vector embeddings (via Pinecone)
- **🧠 RAG-Ready**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline with context-aware document queries
- **🔐 Secure Authentication**: OAuth2 token management for FHIR API integration
- **📊 LOINC Integration**: Standardized medical terminology lookup and validation
- **🐳 Container Ready**: Docker support for easy deployment and scaling
- **🔧 Configurable**: Extensive ```.env```-based configuration options

### 🏗️ Architecture

The server is built with a modular architecture:

- **MCP Tools**: Dedicated tools for selected FHIR resource types, with others handled by a generic tool
- **Fhir Server Client**: Handles FHIR API communication and authentication (OAuth2 and more planned)
- **RAG Services**: Embedding-based document processing and semantic retrieval
- **Vector Store**: Pinecone integration for similarity-based search
- **LOINC Client**: Integration with LOINC API for terminology resolution and validation

## 💡 Demo

This demo shows how Claude uses the `fhir-mcp-server` to communicate with a FHIR server (in this case Medplum) to answer questions. You will see, among other things:

- utilization of the `request_patient_resource` tool which retrieves basic patient information
- utilization of the `request_condition_resource` tool to answer the question whether any of the previously diagnosed diseases may cause symptoms that the patient is currently complaining about
- utilization of the `request_medication_resource`, `request_encounter_resource`, `request_generic_resource` tools to answer the question whether the patient has already received any treatment for hypertension

You can observe how Claude automatically selects the tools worth using to answer the question based on the user's query.

<summary>Lab History Analysis</summary>

Here you can observe how Claude first uses the tool searching for LOINC codes for the lipid panel specific codes, but not finding any related observations in FHIR server, it repeats the search for individual biomarkers that make up such a panel.

<summary>FHIR Synthetic Data Generator</summary>

Developers working with FHIR often need to generate specific test data to validate FHIR server functionality, such as search capabilities and data relationships. While you can use Synthea to generate synthetic data and then manually import the resulting bundles to your server, fhir-mcp-server streamlines this process by allowing you to generate and deploy test data directly through Claude.

This eliminates the typical workflow of running [synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) separately, downloading bundles, and manually importing them to your FHIR server. Instead, you can create targeted test scenarios, generate appropriate synthetic data, and populate your server all within Claude's interface.

**Note:** fhir-mcp-server was not designed with this use case in mind, so as you'll see in the demo, it doesn't work perfectly - what can be observed, however, is how well the LLM handles using trial and error to correct any wrong choices.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up FHIR MCP Server in your environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker (recommended) or uv**: For dependency management

   👉 [uv Installation Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- **FHIR Server Account**: Access to FHIR API (e.g. Medplum)
- **Pinecone API key** (required for document search): Enables vector-based search over processed documents. Without it, semantic retrieval features will be unavailable.

   👉 [Create Pinecone Account](https://www.pinecone.io/)
- **LOINC Account** (optional): Enables retrieval of the latest LOINC codes from the official API. Without it, the system relies on static or language model-inferred codes, which may be outdated or imprecise.

   👉[Create LOINC Account](https://loinc.org/join/)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/the-momentum/fhir-mcp-server
   cd fhir-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```sh
   cp config/.env.example config/.env
   ```
   Edit the `config/.env` file with your credentials and configuration. See [Environment Variables](#-Environment-Variables)

3. **Install Dependencies**

   For Docker-based execution run:
   ```sh
   make build
   ```
   For uv-based execution run:
   ```sh
   make uv
   ```

4. **Update the MCP Client configuration**

   e.g. Claude Desktop -> edit ```claude_desktop_config.json```

- **Docker**

   ```json
   {
      "mcpServers": {
         "docker-mcp-server": {
            "command": "docker",
            "args": [
               "run",
               "-i",
               "--rm",
               "--init",
               "--name",
               "fhir-mcp-server",
               "--mount", // optional - volume for reload
               "type=bind,source=<your-project-path>/app,target=/root_project/app", // optional - volume for reload
               "--mount",
               "type=bind,source=<your-project-path>/config/.env,target=/root_project/config/.env",
               "mcp-server:latest"
            ]
         }
      }
   }
   ```
   Make sure to replace ```<your-project-path>``` with the actual path to your installation

- **uv**

   Firstly, get uv path from terminal:

   - Windows:
      ```
      (Get-Command uv).Path
      ```

   - MacOS/Linux:
      ```
      which uv
      ```
   Then, update config file:

   ```json
   {
      "mcpServers": {
         "uv-mcp-server": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
               "run",
               "--frozen",
               "--directory",
               "<your-project-path>",
               "start"
            ],
            "env": {
            "PATH": "<uv-bin-folder-path>"
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```
   Make sure to replace <uv-bin-folder-path> with the actual uv path (to bin folder)

5. **Restart MCP Client**

   After completing all of the above steps, restart the MCP Client to apply the changes. In some cases, you may need to terminate all related processes using Task Manager or your system's process manager. This ensures that:

   - The updated configuration is properly loaded
   - Environment variables are correctly applied
   - The FHIR MCP client initializes with the correct settings

## 🔧 Configuration

### 🔐 Security & Encryption

The FHIR MCP Server includes built-in encryption infrastructure to protect sensitive configuration values. Sensitive fields like API keys and passwords are automatically encrypted and decrypted at runtime.

You are allowed to store passwords as a plain text, but if you want to have them encrypted, follow the instruction below.

#### Setting Up Encryption

<details>
<summary>Automated Setup (Recommended)</summary>

For most users, use the automated setup script:

```bash
# uv method
uv run scripts/cryptography/setup_encryption.py

# docker method
docker exec fhir-mcp-server uv run scripts/cryptography/setup_encryption.py
```

This script will:
1. Check for `MASTER_KEY` in `config/.env` and generate one if needed
2. Automatically encrypt all sensitive values (`LOINC_PASSWORD`, `FHIR_SERVER_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`)
3. Update your `.env` file with encrypted values
4. Skip empty variables and already encrypted values

</details>

<details>
<summary>Manual Setup</summary>

1. **Generate a Master Key**:
   ```bash
   # uv method
   uv run scripts/cryptography/generate_master_key.py

   # docker method
   docker exec fhir-mcp-server uv run scripts/cryptography/generate_master_key.py
   ```
   Put that key as a MASTER_KEY environment variable in .env.

2. **Encrypt Sensitive Values**:
   ```bash
   # uv method
   uv run scripts/cryptography/encrypt_setting.py "your_secret_value"

    # docker method
   docker exec fhir-mcp-server uv run scripts/cryptography/encrypt_setting.py "your_secret_value"
   ```

3. **Decrypt Values** (for verification):
   ```bash
   # uv method
   uv run scripts/cryptography/decrypt_setting.py "encrypted_value"

    # docker method
   docker exec fhir-mcp-server uv run scripts/cryptography/decrypt_setting.py "encrypted_value"
   ```

</details>
